1)Research agile, scrum, and extreme programming
Agile Software Development with Scrum, by K Schwaber and M. Beedle
Scrum - Framework that applies agile methodology
Agile - SDLC model that applies managable tasks in small time frames to
    custom tailor each project/iteration best suited for the project.
Extreme programming - utilizes some agile methods, but focuses on efficiency and not mvp?

2)why is JS called JS, and what relation to Java?
LiveScript was used in Netscape in '95, which was an implementation 
of ECMAScript.  May have been renamed due to hype of Java at the time.

3)use repl.it for
a. 1+1
b. "cat" + "dog"
c. e^0.01
d. log(2)
e. ln(7)
f. true + false or true && false
__________________________
JS
a = 1+1
console.log(a)

a = "cat" + "dog" 
console.log(a)

a = Math.e^0.01
console.log(a)

a = Math.log(2)  
console.log(a)

a = Math.LN2
console.log(a)

a = true + false
console.log(a)

a = true && false
console.log(a)

Results:
